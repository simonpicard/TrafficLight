## Requirements

### Embedded

Practical details:


The aim of the project is to design and implement an embedded system.
There is no fixed assignment: each team has to devise a topic to work on and send a description of the project to the teacher by the end of March for aproval. A special form is available on the main page for that purpose. To be acknowledged, the project should clearly demonstrate the ability of the team members to apply concepts, tools and techniques studied in at least one of the course chapters (for instance: using Scade to model and validate the system, or using UppAal TiGa or GVS+ to synthesise a part of the system, or applying a PID controler or enforcing real-time constraints thanks to RTAI...)
At the end of the term (date TBA) students will hand out a report that presents the project, and explains how the model-centric approach has been applied. The report should be clearly written in English, French or Dutch, adopting a presentation style up to professional standards. The report should clearly explain what has been done to meet the particular constraints that have been identified as pertaining to the project (correctness, real-time,...)


### Formal verif

#### Goal.
The goal of the project is to implement a small reactive system, provide a formal model of this system, verify appropriate properties on this model using techniques presented in class and software verification tools, and possibly discover bugs and correct the system using these techniques.
####  Deliverables. 
Written report (explaining the system, its conception, the verification process, how it helped and so on) and tool files (models, specifications).
Evaluation. Quality of the written report and oral defense at the end of the semester. Please note that all students of the group are expected to be able to explain all parts of the project.
#### Subject of the project. 
Hence, students could develop the full project for INFOF410, and for our course, they could implement a smaller controller, model it and verify it as discussed before, and compare it with the other controller. Oral defenses could thus be merged. The interest for the students is a reduced workload (not having to develop two separate applications), thus more time to spend on the interesting parts of both projects.
